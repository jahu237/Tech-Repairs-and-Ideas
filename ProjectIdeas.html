      <h1><strong>Bad iMac GPU</strong></h1>
<p>Recently one thing I have noticed at work is how many older iMacs we had sitting around in our back room that are broken. Upon further investigation, I found that all of these were mid 2011 27 inch iMacs. A very common problem for that year's iMac, and Macbook Pro, is that the system overall has poor cooling around where the graphics card is located. This causes major issues when trying to boot up your mac such as long bars across the screen or the color going in and out. The only way to fix this,outside of buying a new card is to reflow the graphics card via heat gun or oven. While this is a highly debated way of fixing these PC's, I thought it would be fun to give it a try and see what happnes! The first step was taking the machine apart. For the most part it was pretty simple. The glass panel on the front is magnetized on so i was able to get it off with a strong smudger. After that there were quite a few screws I had to take out around the sides but eventually the mother board came free!
Once the board was out, the next step was to remove the GPU from its connection to the motherboard. This step was a bit frustrating because of the mess that was getting rid of all the old thermal paste that was in and around the GPU.In order to clean this off, I used a rag and some rubbing alchohol to get the card looking brand new!Once the card was out and clean, it was time to start the process of reflowing. I preheated the oven to 350 degress and once it was ready I placed the graphics card in the oven.After cooking for 10 minutes I took it out and let it cool down for a bit. Once it had been cooled down, I applied new thermal paste to the board to assure for better cooling and upkeep. Once the card was attached to the motherboard again, then cam time to put it all back together.This part was a bit of a struggle because all of the cables for the fans, disks, etc all come up from below the board so i had to strap down the cables on either side with tape, lay the board back into place, and then plug all the cables vack in. Upon boot the system is fully functional again and I have made sure to keep an eye on the temperature with various fan controlling software. Hope you guys enjoyed reading about my project and if you had something similar or thought it was neat let me know in the discussion section! </p>
