  <h2><i>About Me</i></h2>
      <p>Hi! My name is Jeff Huffman and I am currently a student at the University of Kentucky studying Information Communication Technology. This web page will be dedicated to all of my current and upcoming projects within the IT realm. I am currently working as a phone system administrator as well as an Apple administrator. This position has opened me up to so many new ideas and projects and I believed that this would be a great place to share and discuss them. Projects will range from repairing older Apple hardware as well as helpful videos for IT technicians.</p>
